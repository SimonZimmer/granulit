    Hidonash is a Düsseldorf, (DE) based musician, DJ
    and software developer who explores contemporary 
    terrain in experimental music and media art.
    With an interest in machinistic occultism, and
    technological culture, his work intertwines archaic 
    and modernistic motives formulating both intuitive 
    and algorithmic gestures.
    
    As a participant in the founding of the event series 
    sysctl, Hidonash curates the spectrum of electronic 
    music within the Düsseldorfer club-scene.
    He is engaged in several collaborative efforts
    to branch out into various artistic territories 
    which currently include the following projects:
    
    The Dark-Wave live-project 'Exolar', which explores
    intersections between Techno and New Wave within the 
    framework of a live performance. 
    Hidonash: sequencer, laptop, 
    vocals and self-made machinery 
    Yannik Brehm: guitar, sequencer, synthesizer. 
    
    A conceptual album for the project 'KRAFT', as an 
    attempt to fuse technologically driven electronic 
    music and archaic folk-metal, with the singer and
    film-maker <a href="https://www.ozantasci.com/">Ozan Tasci</a>
    
    A conceptual live performance project with the 
    singer and performance artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anastasia.tasime/?hl=de">Anastasia Kapanadze</a>
