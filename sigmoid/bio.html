    Sigmoid is a Düsseldorf, (DE) based musician, DJ
    and software developer constantly exploring new 
    terrain in experimental music and media art.
    His work intertwines archaic and modernistic motives
    and colliding intuitive and algorithmic gestures.
    With an interest in technological occultism, he is
    interested in machinistic occultism and modern
    technological culture.
    
    As a participant in the founding of the event series 
    Vertigo, Sigmoid curates the spectrum of electronic 
    music within the Düsseldorfer club-scene. 
    He is engaged in several collaborative efforts
    to branch out into various artistic territories 
    which currently include the following projects:
    
    The Dark-Wave live-project 'Exolar', which explores
    intersections between Techno and New Wave within the 
    framework of a live performance. 
    Sigmoid: sequencer, laptop, 
    vocals and self-made machinery 
    Yannik Brehm: guitar, sequencer, synthesizer.
