("
    Granulit is a Düsseldorf, Germany based producer 
    and DJ who currently discovers new musical 
    terrain in experimental techno. His signature 
    sound intertwines mystic harmonies and archaic 
    drums with heavily processed field recordings 
    yielding abstract motives. In a conflict of both 
    intuitive and algorithmic gestures, complex and 
    strange atmospheres emerge, creating an obscure 
    acoustic scenery. The debut EP "undreamed" was 
    released in October 2015 on Black Hills Recordings. 
    In 2017, he joined Haut und Knochen, a creative 
    collective consisting of musicians, designers and 
    art directors, set out to combat the mainstream 
    and revitalize the subculture as an inindependent 
    event series. As a participant in the founding 
    of the event series Vertigo, he further curates 
    the spectrum of electronic music within the 
    Düsseldorfer club-scene. Granulit is also 
    engaged in several collaborative projects in an
    effort to branch out into other musical 
    territories:

    The Dark-Wave live-project Exolar, exploring 
    intersections between Techno and New Wave within 
    the framework of a live performance. 
    Granulit: sequencer, laptop, vocals and 
    self- made controllers.
    Guitarist Yannik Brehm: guitar, sequencer, 
    synthesizer.

    A conceptual album as an attempt to fuse 
    technologically driven electronic music and 
    nature-inspired black metal, with the singer 
    and film-maker Ozan Tasci

    An experimental EP with the Producer/DJ, 
    pursuing old- and new school Electro Aesthetics
