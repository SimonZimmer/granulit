("Granulit is a Düsseldorf, Germany based producer 
and DJ who currently discovers new musical terrain 
in experimental techno. His signature sound 
intertwines mystic harmonies and archaic drums 
with heavily processed field recordings yielding 
abstract motives. In a conflict of both intuitive
and algorithmic gestures, complex and strange 
atmospheres emerge, creating an obscure acoustic 
scenery. The debut EP "undreamed" was released in 
October 2015 on Black Hills Recordings. In 2017, 
he joined Haut und Knochen, a creative collective 
consisting of musicians, designers and art directors, 
set out to combat the mainstream and revitalize the
subculture as an inindependent event series. As a
participant in the founding of the event series 
Vertigo, he further curates the spectrum of 
electronic music within the Düsseldorfer club-scene. 
Granulit is engaged in several collaborative 
efforts to branch out into other musical 
territories. At the moment, he's working on a 
few projects:
            
The Dark-Wave live-project Exolar, exploring 
intersections between Techno and New Wave within the 
framework of a live 
performance. Granulit: sequencer, laptop, vocals and 
self- made controllers.
Guitarist Yannik Brehm: guitar, sequencer, 
synthesizer.
            
A conceptual album as an attempt to fuse 
technologically driven electronic music and 
nature-inspired black metal, with the singer and 
film-maker Ozan Tasci

An experimental EP with the Producer/DJ , pursuing 
old- and new school Electro Aesthetics")
